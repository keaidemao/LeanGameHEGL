Title "Proving v is a Unit"

Introduction "
In this level, we prove that under the following conditions v is a unit.
That is, if p is prime, p divides u, and p = u * v, then v must be a unit.
Recall that a number v is a unit if  there exists some q with q * v = 1.
"

-- The exercise: prove that if (prime p) ∧ (p ∣ u) ∧ (p = u * v), then v is a unit.
Statement v_unit (p u v : Nat) : (prime p) ∧ (p ∣ u) ∧ (p = u * v) → unit v := by
  Hint "Introduce the hypothesis into your context."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Begin with 'intro h' to bring the whole hypothesis into scope."
  intro h
  Hint "Decompose the hypothesis into its constituent parts."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Apply 'rcases h with ⟨p_prime, p_dvd_u, p_eq_uv⟩' to split the conjunction into three separate assumptions."
  rcases h with ⟨p_prime, p_dvd_u, p_eq_uv⟩
  Hint "From the divisibility p ∣ u, extract a witness q such that u = p * q."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Use 'rcases p_dvd_u with ⟨q, u_eq_pq⟩' to obtain a natural number q and the equality u = p * q."
  rcases p_dvd_u with ⟨q, u_eq_pq⟩
  Hint "Simplify the definition of unit (which asserts the existence of a multiplicative inverse)."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Unfold the definition with 'dsimp only [unit]'."
  dsimp only [unit]
  Hint "Provide the witness q for v being a unit."
  Hint (hidden := true) "The 'exists' tactic supplies a value to fulfill the existential claim. Use 'exists q'."
  exists q
  Hint "Use the substitution property from Level 3 to obtain an intermediate equality."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Invoke the substitution property with: 'have p_eq_pqv : p = p * (q * v) := substitution_in_Nat p q u v ⟨u_eq_pq, p_eq_uv⟩'."
  Hint "The 'have' tactic lets you introduce a new statement for later use. It is similar to stating an auxiliary lemma inside your proof. Write the statement, a colon with its type, then ':=' followed by the proof or expression."
  have p_eq_pqv : p = p * (q * v) := substitution_in_Nat p q u v ⟨u_eq_pq, p_eq_uv⟩
  Hint "Apply the cancellation property (from Level 1) to deduce that 1 = q * v."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Next, we prove 1 = q * v using a 'have' block. Remember that when using 'by', the subsequent proof must be indented."
  have one_is_qv : 1 = q * v := by
    Hint "Within the 'by' block, start by rewriting the left-hand side of the equality. The 'conv' tactic allows you to focus on a specific part of an expression."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Focus on the left-hand side using 'lhs'."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Rewrite the left-hand side using the identity '← Nat.mul_one p'."
    conv at p_eq_pqv =>
    lhs
    rw [← Nat.mul_one p]
    Hint "After rewriting, apply the cancellation property. This line must be indented further inside the 'by' block."
    exact cancellation_in_Nat 1 (q * v) p ⟨p_eq_pqv, p_prime.2⟩
  Hint "Finally, conclude by constructing the unit for v."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Use the 'constructor' tactic to build the unit, supplying the two required proofs. In the second part, use 'rewrite [Nat.mul_comm]' to adjust the order before applying the proof.
  constructor¬
    · exact one_is_qv_symm¬
    · rewrite [Nat.mul_comm]¬
      exact one_is_qv.symm

  Write · with a backslash and a dot"
  constructor
  · exact one_is_qv.symm
  · rewrite [Nat.mul_comm]
    exact one_is_qv.symm


Conclusion "
Excellent! You have successfully proven that under the given conditions v is a unit.
